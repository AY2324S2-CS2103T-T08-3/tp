### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sorting contact list

This feature allows users to sort their addressbook based on various information, namely, name, company
name, interview time, salary and priority. This feature leverages on the built-in `ObservableList` provided by JavaFX.
The sorting is done by creating classes that implements the Comparator<T> interface.
* `PersonCompanyNameComparator.java`
* `PersonInterviewTimeComparator.java`
* `PersonNameComparator.java`
* `PersonPriorityComparator.java`
* `PersonSalaryComparator.java`

These comparators are referenced in the `SortCommandParser`. In the `SortCommandParser` each comparator will be assigned
a static integer based on the CLI Syntax from the userInput. The string is that parsed and assigned an integer from 
**1 - 4** which are pre-assigned to a comparator.

#### Overview of SortCommand
![sort_overview_2.png](images/sortoverview2.png)<br>
Based on the image above:
* Step 1: User inputs `sort pri/` which calls the `execute()` function in the `LogicManager` object.
  * `pri/` is an added CLI Syntax to refer to priority which is an added attribute to `Person` class.
* Step 2: `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand()` function in `AddressBookParser` object which interprets the `sort`
<br> command word and creates a `SortCommandParser` object.
* Step 3: The `SortCommandParser` object then parses `pri/` and create the `SortCommand` object.
  * `SortCommand` constructor takes in an **Integer**  and `SortCommandParser` already pre-assigns `pri/` to 0.
* Step 4: `LogicManager` then executes the command.
* Step 5: `SortCommand` will call `updateSortedPersonList()` from the `Model` object which has a reference to the
`AddressBook` which contains the `UniquePersonList` object. The `UniquePersonList` then sorts it based on the
comparator.

### Job Difficulty Feature
![job_difficulty_class](images/JobDifficultyDiagram.png)
#### Overview
The job difficulty feature allows program auto calculate a difficulty score for a job 
based on the company name and salary. 
This feature leverages on the local storage of 
famous company names and their job difficulty levels.  

#### Class Structure
The `JobDifficulty` class is responsible for calculating the 
job difficulty score. It uses the `CompanyName` and `Salary` classes 
to retrieve the necessary information.

#### Method Details
`JobDifficulty(CompanyName companyName, Salary salary)` <br>
This is the constructor for the JobDifficulty class. 
It takes in a CompanyName object and a Salary object. 
It retrieves the difficulty level of the company and adds 
it to the salary to calculate the job difficulty score.

`getDifficulty()` <br>
This method returns the calculated job difficulty score


### Filtering of list by interview time, tags, salary range, and programming languages feature
This feature allows users to filter their lists according to the interview time range, tags, salary range 
and programming language.

#### Implementation
The `FilterCommand` class is an abstract class inherited by concrete classes, `FilterInterviewTimeCommand`, 
`FilterTagCommand`, `FilterSalaryCommand` and `FilterProgrammingLanguageCommand` which will filter the list 
according to their respective categories. 


**Process:**
1. FilterCommandParser class will determine a concrete subclass of FilterCommand to be returned.
2. The concrete FilterCommandClass will check if their respective categories (interview times, tags, etc.) in the 
   contact list contain the keyword
3. Return the list of contacts which contain the keyword

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. _{explain how to simulate a missing/corrupted file, and the expected behavior}_

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5
1. **Have an error message show up when the data file is corrupted on startup**: The current address book simply starts
up with an empty list when the data in the json file is corrupted or has an invalid format. The current implementation
has a logger warning shown in the developer console, but not the app itself. We plan have an error message show up on
results display after startup of the app when the data is corrupted.

2. **Allow `filter` command to filter the contact list based on a combination of categories**: The current `filter`
command only allows the contact list to be filtered based on one specific category such as tags, salary range etc
and this may not be useful for users with a very huge number of contacts as filtering by only one category may still
return a long list. It is also not convenient for users who want to find contacts more specifically. We plan to
allow `filter` to filter the contact list more specifically. (e.g. `filter t/TAG s/SALARY_RANGE` will return
contacts with matching `TAG` and `SALARY_RANGE` that falls within what is specified)
